The main objective for this kata is to practice baby step refactoring while using the technique of the Mikado graph.

The goal is to prepare the code for the addition of a new discount type: "Two for one".
First, refactor the code of "Three for two", which is similar to "Two for one", using a Mikado graph.
Then, add the new discount type.

The main objective for this kata is to practice baby step refactoring while using 2 main techniques:

- Scratch method
- Mikado Method

Scratch method:
- Apply scratch method to add a new discount type such as the "Two for one", in order to understand what parts of the code need to be modified.
- Identify the similarities  between the "Three for two" and "Two for one" discounts
- Write a function that computes the discount for these 2 types 
- Put their common properties in a base class

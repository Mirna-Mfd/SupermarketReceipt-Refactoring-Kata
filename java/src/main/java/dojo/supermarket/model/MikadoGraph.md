## Note about Mikado Graph format

There are many ways to build a Mikado Graph, each of them coming with its pros & cons

- Using a **text file** as in here is a simple and cheap way to do it,
  with the advantage that it can easily be shared remotely and stored in source control along with the code being refactored
- Another solution is to use **post-it on a board** when all contributors are in the same location
- Another nice-looking solution is to use a **mind-mapping tool**, as long as everyone in the team is able to access it
